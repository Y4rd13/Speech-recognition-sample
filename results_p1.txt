 I know that it's a weird time I mess and all you guys let's try this out okay so I'm going to start sharing my screen here and then we're going to go in here and then see what you guys what you guys can do thumbs up from some people here
 yes got that you trying to see the PowerPoint Mariah
 Joe West what's that I want started at the beginning so basically guys next 15 minutes or so I just want to go over kind of what kind of what we're doing here in terms of learning objectives and some other things that are going to be going on all right Huracan Mitch here Grace can you see when can you see what I'm doing on the screen
 good stuff I get talking to you KB KB said to that she says that she's still waiting all girl I'll go letter in thanks cool
 I guess I got to stop and pause the share like there's going to be some hiccups today I getting this thing on how the hell do I let
 maybe. Hopefully I'll let her know maybe it started like a waiting room on Friday I'll just once you join you're just going to get in so I don't have to keep letting everybody in
 so like I said I'm recording this to so if you can't get it right now you can look at it later so let's go back and let's look at the powerful in here prizmax my tweets are going to be different
 you know it's just kind of is what it is all right they're probably more than a couple more handouts like I said they're going to be the same kind of videos 5-10 minutes here and there and figure out how we're going to do it so combine all those the quizzes are going to remain the same explain to you when those quizzes are going to be happening we got two more 567 days to work on them in tournament whenever so everything stay in the same except
 you know be nice but sending messages okay don't be mean to me just done it upsets me and I Cry okay so here's a want to do okay we're at about the getting close to the 15-minute Mark for our meeting today and we're only going to be here like I said for half an hour so what I want to do is just like we do in class take 2-3 minutes and just kind of jot down or write down on a notebooks and your phone's whatever you're using note me know anyting
 what do you think all right so just do like I said to three minutes on that and like I said it's odd and it's bizarre and you're by yourself and your in a room and just kind of imagine that you're in a classroom the best way to do it and see if anything comes to mind when you think of nationalism write some things down I want to I'm going to stop sharing here in a minute and then we're going to use the chat feature
 running nationalism I think for some reason for me I think of song all right I think the songs I think of national anthem is that Rosetta cold start okay so if you guys got any other ones use the
 it's nice seeing everybody really is national flags that's a good one
 kulture Pride these are all things I'm going to put in the PowerPoint okay once we get done with our session today I'm going to put these suggestions in the PowerPoint
 but I got one then she said sometimes can be bigots what was that amount on me for my way meme like I'd wait Supreme is own how that can turn into nationalism where they think that they're better than everybody else yeah that's awesome that's a great one and so one of things were going to look at with nationalism sometimes they can get really ugly okay for instance you guys were little but after 9/11 happened because I said yes what little there was this explosion of all kinds of songs about Nina patriotism and things and a lot of them were written by Toby Keith what will talk about a lot of its good points going for patriotic feelings I like that
 Jarrod Schulz social values by social values I know what Hannah said earlier about right white supremacist I don't know I can't think of examples
 I think that's definitely an aspect of nationalism where you tried to see what binds us all together culturally with our values and those types of things a big one here that I'm going to write down okay is that we just got done with this when we all went on break but nationalism is really really really romantic okay it's a really romantic idea that we're all the same and we're all together and we all want to be a part of a bigger team okay it's a really really interesting idea
 keep this up we're going to do what's called I want to do a thing called national anthem week and we're going to listen to a bunch of different national anthem stop from all over the world okay release an hour's we're going to listen to Italy's we're going to listen to me know England's and Francis and Germany's and you're going to start reading these national anthems in your going to be like that's a little different than ours you may have the Pennies on our national anthem and its really nondescript you know and some of these national anthems you're going to read that you're going to be like yeah Ike's the next time you hear the Olympics are you watch a soccer game where they all get together and they blink arms and they sang their national anthem you know some of the words that you never understood before you're going to be like ready
 alright so where are we let's just kind of literally reset the map okay basically where we are and because this is a world history class in American history class and we got a ton of move decently quickly over the next five weeks
 so that is no matter what you think about it okay by the America and just let's get out of that from that's really really really inspirational to a lot of countries around the world that hey I can we can form up our national anthem okay we can form up our own culture and in those types of things does that make sense so
 chop their heads off in a really ugly and awful violent way okay and they literally chop off the head of the state and start a new state when that happens it unleashes all kinds of new stuff in France and everybody wants to have their own opinions on what's going to be this new government okay will the long and short of it is that it unleashes a brand-new upward Lee mobile Society where people that never used to count or from the lower classes were able to work their way up to the top by either becoming a really good Merchant or in the next guy's case that we're going to look at becoming really good at military and really good at War okay and that's where all these new people start making their names for themselves and France okay and so the French Revolution has some good things to have some bad things to it and so the big thing we're going to get into as we click to the next train to look at this guy named Napoleon because Napoleon the guy that kicks off this whole thing on his National
 basically get the the Bayou the big Bayou stuff on the plane from that hand out and stuff that I gave him the videos okay where he's from you know how he grew up in those types of things that's all important but the big thing was Napoleon as a military guy 92 prominence he grew up through the system as a military guy
 counselor on page 661 when I put the big thing is that once he gets into Power he starts establishing his own government which is the big thing on page 661 the Napoleonic Code okay that's the thing I want you guys did to look at with that definition alright and basically what it did is as it says with definition promotes the equality of all male citizens that's the big thing male citizens right women lose a lot of legal rights when Napoleon takes power okay basically what Napoleon was is he was a guy to believe that the French Revolution went a little too far and giving everybody writes and basically what he's doing is he's having a conservative reaction to it and he's like that's two equal men and women are not going to be equal under the law so basically what does he kind of cuts off a lot of women's rights and institutes these for only men bizarrely ugly situation in many countries died in the French live this out with Napoleon
 thumbs up and then when we get back in here on Friday I'll send you another invitation will come back in at 11:15 on Friday what kind of go over some other things and then we'll really get into how Napoleon makes other countries upset by taking them over and then they start reacting against him and what it does is when the other countries react against Napoleon it blows up with nationalism everybody says I want my own country I want Italy I want Spain I want Germany Etc everybody I said everybody's going to want their own country coming up pretty soon that's kind of Napoleon takes that all off when he starts taking over and invading other places I'll go over that in the nuts all right
 you looking at those definition of 661 awesome I got was a good for the first day and so is good for the first day like I said I will put that out in a PowerPoint fashion here in a little bit and then I'll see everybody back in here Friday at 11:50
 all right guys have a great day be safe okay see you
